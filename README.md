 For the midterm, the teacher assigned us to do individual work. The content is about exercises learned in class and includes self-study about Prolog. I got 9.0 points on this exercise and have an excel file for self-assessment during the exercise.

 In the final lesson, the teacher instructed us to do group work. Groups of maximum 3 members, me and my classmates combine to make it more complete. The content of the exercise has easy and difficult parts. Learn and research new laws and algorithms. This exercise is checked for plagiarism and the code is run on the computer to track the time it takes to complete the algorithm. For this exercise, my group got 10/10 points with this absolute score and I'm proud of it.
